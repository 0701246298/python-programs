The
function
definition
has
a
typo(Def
should
be


def ).


The
parameter
names in the
function
definition
should
be
consistent(varOne and varTwo
instead
of
varOne and vartwo).
There
's a missing comma between the parameters in the function definition.
The
second
print
statement
has
a
typo(vartwo
should
be
varTwo).
    In the corrected code, the function checkingVariable is defined with two parameters (varOne and varTwo). varOne has a default value of 9.

Now, let's analyze the output of the function calls:

    For checkingVariable(12, "twelve"):
        varOne is 12, and varTwo is "twelve".
        The first print statement will attempt to add an integer (varOne) to a string (varTwo), which will raise a TypeError. To avoid this, you may want to ensure that both parameters are of compatible types.
        The second print statement will not be executed due to the error in the first statement.

    For checkingVariable(varTwo=4):
        varOne takes its default value of 9, and varTwo is set to 4.
        The first print statement will output 13 (9 + 4).
        The second print statement will output 16 (4^2).

So, you need to handle the data types appropriately in your function calls to avoid potential errors.
